To add a food point to the service, the owner of the food point must provide the service representatives with information about the available dishes, their photos, cost, and other information that must be communicated to the customers in accordance with the current legislation or contract.
They should reflect the mode of operation, the name of the restaurant, the weight of the dish (in grams), make a short description, specify the category, price, and cooking time.

We start working after the restaurant provides the required materials and accepts the offer. The Company may terminate the contract unilaterally if it does not comply with the requirements specified in it.
Organizations registered as a legal entity or individual entrepreneur are accepted for cooperation. The company does not disclose clear requirements that the restaurant must meet. Questions about joining the service are resolved individually based on the completed questionnaire. The restaurant undertakes to provide only reliable and complete information that complies with the law
